# Given the names and grades for each student in a Physics class of  students, 
#store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

# Note: If there are multiple students with the same grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

# Input Format

# The first line contains an integer, N , the number of students. 
# The 2N subsequent lines describe each student over  lines; the first line contains a student's name, and the second line contains their grade.

# # Constraints

# 2<=N<=5

# # There will always be one or more students having the second lowest grade.
# # Output Format

# # Print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade in Physics; if there are multiple students, order their names alphabetically and print each one on a new line.
# Sample Input
# 5
# Harry
# 37.21
# Berry
# 37.21
# Tina
# 37.2
# Akriti
# 41
# Harsh
# 39

# Sample Output
# Berry
# Harry
